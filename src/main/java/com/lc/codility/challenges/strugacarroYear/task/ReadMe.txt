a simple code challenge I have been passed before

Strugacarro is a planet whose year is divided into four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn in that order.
A year has N days and every season lasts for exactly N/4 days. The year starts on the first day of winter and ends on the last day of autumn.
Given the history of temperatures from the previous year, find the season with the highest amplitude of temperatures.
The amplitude is the difference between the highest and lowesr temperatures over the given period.
Assume that all seasons within one year have different temperature amplitudes.
